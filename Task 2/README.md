# Task 2 solution
**To simulate my solution for this task:** https://wokwi.com/projects/342886834621121106
## Code basic solutions
[x] For saving information about hardware output to LEDs I used enumeration. It adds readability and allowed me to modify pins effectively.

[x] For iterating through pins I used global variabe to save it and function set_next_LED().

[x] To Blink I've turned LED for 10ms and then turned it off, after what went to delay. 

[x] To adjust delay I used basic clamp (by multiplying it with relation).
