# Task 1.2 solution
## Code basic solutions
[x] While providing macros I've used parentheses around parameters in case of some expression in it. Because macros just substitute it's code to place, 
where they called on preprocessing stage, expression would not be calculated before macro called, so we need to add parentheses, to avoid undefined calculation order.

[x] For bitwise shifts better use unsigned integers to avoid undefined behaviour.

[x] I've used bit-wizardy to calculate or transform numbers in macro:
  1. SET_BIT(x, p): set p-th bit of x to 1
     - We take constant 1 (00...01)
     - Move it's only nonzero bit to p-th position
     - Use bitwise OR to set p-th bit to 1

  2. CLR_BIT(x, p): set p-th bit of x to 1
     - We take constant 1 (00...01)
     - Move it's only nonzero bit to p-th position
     - Use negation to swap for all bits: 0 <-> 1
     - Use and to ignore all other bits and set p-th bit to 0

  3. TGL_BIT(x, p): negate p-th bit of x
     - We take constant 1 (00...01)
     - Move it's only nonzero bit to p-th position
     - We use bitwise XOR which works as negation on p-th bit
  
 4. CHK_BIT(x, p): return p-th bit value of x
     - We shift x to the left with p bits to set p-th bit on position 0
     - Use bitwise AND to check this last bit (if it's nonzero -> it's 1, otherwise -> it's zero)

[x] To convert int to string I used shift method: by shifting <size> times, every time check last bit and add it to the string.
  
[x] I've provided basic tests in main() to check every macro.
